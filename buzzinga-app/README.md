## Run
- Start this server via `node app.js`.
- Make sure the Playstation Buzz USB-Dongle is connected to your machine before server-start

## Hints on pairing the wireless buzz buzzers
First plug in the USB dongle. Next take your first controller and move the switch to the upper position and hold it like that until the blue led at the bottom lights up. Repeat this step for all controllers. When done press the button on your USB dongle and hold it until the blue LED lights up.
Then release the button and press it once more. Now you can start your node program to access the buzzer.
